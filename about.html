      so i jumped into programing because it was the best platform to create things i wanted to create.
    i wanted to save time and energy that people spent by working manually.
    and i also wanted to solve some problems in my country and being a software developper its easier to reach
     people because most of the population of our country is able to access digital devices .
     so this i how i chose to be a software developer.i m also a student who is still learning thats why i joined moringa school to enhance my skills in coding.</p>
